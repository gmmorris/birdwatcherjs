A small utility for implementing the NCZ Javascript error handling anti-pattern.","body":"Birdwatcher JS\r\n=======\r\n\r\nA small utility for implementing the NCZ JavaScript error handling anti-pattern.\r\nTo understand the anti-pattern: http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2009/04/28/javascript-error-handling-anti-pattern/\r\n\r\n### Basic usage\r\n\r\nTo use birdwatcher, all you have to do is tell birdwatcher to spy on an object and set the callback you wish to have called when an error is raised.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"birdwatcher.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\n```js\r\n    window.theKing = {\r\n        giveUpThrone: function(){\r\n            throw new Error(\"The king will never be over thrown!\");\r\n        }\r\n    };\r\n\r\n\r\n    birdwatcher.configuration({\r\n        onError:function(exception,method){\r\n            if(method == \"giveUpThrone\") {\r\n                assassin.killKing();\r\n            } else {\r\n                // some other error took place\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    birdwatcher(window.theKing);\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Advanced usage\r\n\r\n#### Specifying different callbacks for a specific object\r\n\r\nBy calling the birdwatcher.configuration() function youcan change the default configuration which is used globally when attaching the birdwatcher functionality to any object.\r\nIf you want to specify a non default configuration variable for a specific object you can override default values of the configuration specifically for the current object when calling the main birdwatcher method by using the second argument.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n    window.theKing = {\r\n        giveUpThrone: function(){\r\n            throw new Error(\"The king will never be over thrown!\");\r\n        }\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    window.theAssassin = {\r\n        killTheKing: function(){\r\n            this.injectPoison(window.theKing);\r\n        },\r\n        killThePrince: function(){\r\n            throw new Error(\"No women and children!\");\r\n        }\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    birdwatcher(window.theKing);\r\n    birdwatcher(window.theAssassin,{\r\n        onError:function(exception,method){\r\n            // notify the rebels that the assassin has failed\r\n            // or rather when theAssassin.killThePrince() is called\r\n            // presumably that wasn't prince Joffrey, because that was no child, that was a monster!\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    birdwatcher.configuration({\r\n        onError:function(exception,method){\r\n            // all other error which were raised\r\n\r\n            if(method == \"giveUpThrone\") {\r\n                //will be called when the king is challenged to give up the throne\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Watching a single function\r\n\r\nIf you wish to plug a specific method of an object or a function variable into the birdwatcher mechanism you can call the main birdwatcher function and pass the specific method/variable as the first argument, same as with an object.\r\nNote though, that in order to call the function variable you will have to replace the reference you have to it manually.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n    var myErrorHandledFunction = function(){\r\n\t\t// ...\r\n\t};\r\n\t\r\n    var myObject = {\r\n\t\tmyErrorHandledMethod : function(){\r\n\t\t\t// ...\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t};\r\n\r\n    myErrorHandledFunction = birdwatcher(myErrorHandledFunction);\r\n    myObject.myErrorHandledMethod = birdwatcher(myObject.myErrorHandledMethod);\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Preventing a rethrow\r\n\r\nThe default is to rethrow an error once it is caught, so that the normal error flow can be maintained even when an error\r\nis caught for special usages (such as logging).\r\nYou cen prevent the rethrow from happening by setting the rethrow config to false.\r\nThis can be used globally or at a single object's level.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n    birdwatcher.configuration({\r\n        rethrow:false\r\n    });\r\n```\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
